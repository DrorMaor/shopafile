        Is this site really free to use? <span style="font-weight:bold;">Yes it is!</span>
        <br>
        So, how do we make money?
        <br>
        There are other sites out there that provide a similar service, allowing you to sell your digital products.
        <br>
        But all of them charge you lots of money each month just to keep your files there, whether you make a sale or not.
        <br>
        We are different, and we don't want to take your money like that.
        <br>
        Instead, our site is commision-based ONLY. We take just 8% of the price of your file, and only once you sell it.
        <br>
        So, if you want to sell your file for $25.00, we will receive just $2.00, while you keep the rest.
        <br>
        (The only exception is if you set your price lower than $12.50, we will receive the minimum $0.99.)
        <br>
        It's as simple as that. There are no hidden fees whatsover.
        <br>
        Make a sale, keep 92% of the money! Don't make a sale, you won't be charged a thing.
