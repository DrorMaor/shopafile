            You worked hard to create your digital product, and you want to sell it.
            <br>
            You know that many online shopping sites don't allow the sale of any digital products, only tangible items.
            <br>
            Welcome to Shopafile! Where you can buy and sell any digital product.
            <br>
            If you're a seller, just upload your file, and click the "Link" link (&#128540;) next to it.
            This will copy the sell URL of your file, and you can share it with the world.
            <br>
            Once someone has this link, when they click it they'll be sent directly to purchase your file.
            <br>
            As soon as the sale goes through, you will receive 92% of the price in your PayPal Account.
